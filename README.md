# Stream Abstraction

Allow DAOs with large treasuries & DeFi users to collateralize their treasuries, and take out loans in the form of streams - without having to sell assets to do so!

## Local Deployment
You can deploy the contract to any network with:

```cmd
cd backend
brownie run scripts/deploy.py
```

You can run the frontend on your local environment using the following commands
```cmd
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
